# david-goggins-tribute-page
A simple tribute page dedicated to David Goggins. It is my first web development personal project, so I tried to keep it simple with a black and white color palette.
It was all about making a responsive page to understand the basics of HTML and CSS. 
I chose David Goggins because I recently read his book "Can't Hurt Me" it truly resonated with me.
