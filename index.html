    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      David Goggins is one of those people that had a childhood that set him up to fail. Growing up,his father abused him and his mother, forcing them  to leave their home in Williamsville, New York.They relocated to Brazil, Indiana,  a small town where David was the only black kid around, and people let him know it. In school, he wasn't a fast learner. He had so much trouble studying that he only managed to graduate high school by cheating through every exam. In his 20s he was overweight and earned a living killing cockroaches, rats, and other pests in restaurants.

      He certainly did not have a bright future ahead. Knowing this, he took the decision to change. He put all his time and effort into becoming a person he could be proud of, one that wouldn’t let his past define who he was supposed to be. By hard work and dedication, he became one of the toughest persons on the planet. Here are some achievements that prove it:
